In the
Pages documentation
and the
Data Fetching documentation
, we talked about how to pre-render a page at build time (
Static Generation
) using
getStaticProps
and
getStaticPaths
.
Static Generation is useful when your pages fetch data from a headless CMS. However, it’s not ideal when you’re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to
preview
the draft immediately on your page. You’d want Next.js to render these pages at
request time
instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. You’d want Next.js to bypass Static Generation only for this specific case.
Next.js has a feature called
Preview Mode
which solves this problem. Here are instructions on how to use it.
Step 1: Create and access a preview API route
Take a look at the
API Routes documentation
first if you’re not familiar with Next.js API Routes.
First, create a
preview API route
. It can have any name - e.g.
pages/api/preview.js
(or
.ts
if using TypeScript).
In this API route, you need to call
setPreviewData
on the response object. The argument for
setPreviewData
should be an object, and this can be used by
getStaticProps
(more on this later). For now, we’ll use
{}
.
export
default
function
handler
(req
,
res) {
// ...
res
.setPreviewData
({})
// ...
}
res.setPreviewData
sets some
cookies
on the browser which turns on the preview mode. Any requests to Next.js containing these cookies will be considered as the
preview mode
, and the behavior for statically generated pages will change (more on this later).
You can test this manually by creating an API route like below and accessing it from your browser manually:
pages/api/preview.js
// simple example for testing it manually from your browser.
export
default
function
handler
(req
,
res) {
res
.setPreviewData
({})
res
.end
(
'Preview mode enabled'
)
}
If you open your browser’s developer tools and visit
/api/preview
, you’ll notice that the
__prerender_bypass
and
__next_preview_data
cookies will be set on this request.
Securely accessing it from your Headless CMS
In practice, you’d want to call this API route
securely
from your headless CMS. The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you’re using, but here are some common steps you could take.
These steps assume that the headless CMS you’re using supports setting
custom preview URLs
. If it doesn’t, you can still use this method to secure your preview URLs, but you’ll need to construct and access the preview URL manually.
First
, you should create a
secret token string
using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS. This secret prevents people who don’t have access to your CMS from accessing preview URLs.
Second
, if your headless CMS supports setting custom preview URLs, specify the following as the preview URL. This assumes that your preview API route is located at
pages/api/preview.js
.
Terminal
https://<your-site>/api/preview?secret=<token>
&
slug
=<
pat
h
>
<your-site>
should be your deployment domain.
<token>
should be replaced with the secret token you generated.
<path>
should be the path for the page that you want to preview. If you want to preview
/posts/foo
, then you should use
&slug=/posts/foo
.
Your headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the preview URL so that
<path>
can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so:
&slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}
Finally
, in the preview API route:
Check that the secret matches and that the
slug
parameter exists (if not, the request should fail).
Call
res.setPreviewData
.
Then redirect the browser to the path specified by
slug
. (The following example uses a
307 redirect
).
export
default
async
(req
,
res)
=>
{
// Check the secret and next parameters
// This secret should only be known to this API route and the CMS
if
(
req
.
query
.secret
!==
'MY_SECRET_TOKEN'
||
!
req
.
query
.slug) {
return
res
.status
(
401
)
.json
({ message
:
'Invalid token'
})
}
// Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists
// getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS
const
post
=
await
getPostBySlug
(
req
.
query
.slug)
// If the slug doesn't exist prevent preview mode from being enabled
if
(
!
post) {
return
res
.status
(
401
)
.json
({ message
:
'Invalid slug'
})
}
// Enable Preview Mode by setting the cookies
res
.setPreviewData
({})
// Redirect to the path from the fetched post
// We don't redirect to req.query.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities
res
.redirect
(
post
.slug)
}
If it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to preview with the preview mode cookies being set.
Step 2: Update
getStaticProps
The next step is to update
getStaticProps
to support the preview mode.
If you request a page which has
getStaticProps
with the preview mode cookies set (via
res.setPreviewData
), then
getStaticProps
will be called at
request time
(instead of at build time).
Furthermore, it will be called with a
context
object where:
context.preview
will be
true
.
context.previewData
will be the same as the argument used for
setPreviewData
.
export
async
function
getStaticProps
(context) {
// If you request this page with the preview mode cookies set:
//
// - context.preview will be true
// - context.previewData will be the same as
//   the argument used for `setPreviewData`.
}
We used
res.setPreviewData({})
in the preview API route, so
context.previewData
will be
{}
. You can use this to pass session information from the preview API route to
getStaticProps
if necessary.
If you’re also using
getStaticPaths
, then
context.params
will also be available.
Fetch preview data
You can update
getStaticProps
to fetch different data based on
context.preview
and/or
context.previewData
.
For example, your headless CMS might have a different API endpoint for draft posts. If so, you can use
context.preview
to modify the API endpoint URL like below:
export
async
function
getStaticProps
(context) {
// If context.preview is true, append "/preview" to the API endpoint
// to request draft data instead of published data. This will vary
// based on which headless CMS you're using.
const
res
=
await
fetch
(
`https://.../
${
context
.preview
?
'preview'
:
''
}
`
)
// ...
}
That’s it! If you access the preview API route (with
secret
and
slug
) from your headless CMS or manually, you should now be able to see the preview content. And if you update your draft without publishing, you should be able to preview the draft.
Set this as the preview URL on your headless CMS or access manually, and you should be able to see the preview.
Terminal
https://<your-site>/api/preview?secret=<token>
&
slug
=<
pat
h
>
More Details
Good to know
: during rendering
next/router
exposes an
isPreview
flag, see the
router object docs
for more info.
Specify the Preview Mode duration
setPreviewData
takes an optional second parameter which should be an options object. It accepts the following keys:
maxAge
: Specifies the number (in seconds) for the preview session to last for.
path
: Specifies the path the cookie should be applied under. Defaults to
/
enabling preview mode for all paths.
setPreviewData
(data
,
{
maxAge
:
60
*
60
,
// The preview mode cookies expire in 1 hour
path
:
'/about'
,
// The preview mode cookies apply to paths with /about
})
Clear the Preview Mode cookies
By default, no expiration date is set for Preview Mode cookies, so the preview session ends when the browser is closed.
To clear the Preview Mode cookies manually, create an API route that calls
clearPreviewData()
:
pages/api/clear-preview-mode-cookies.js
export
default
function
handler
(req
,
res) {
res
.clearPreviewData
({})
}
Then, send a request to
/api/clear-preview-mode-cookies
to invoke the API Route. If calling this route using
next/link
, you must pass
prefetch={false}
to prevent calling
clearPreviewData
during link prefetching.
If a path was specified in the
setPreviewData
call, you must pass the same path to
clearPreviewData
:
pages/api/clear-preview-mode-cookies.js
export
default
function
handler
(req
,
res) {
const
{
path
}
=
req
.query
res
.clearPreviewData
({ path })
}
previewData
size limits
You can pass an object to
setPreviewData
and have it be available in
getStaticProps
. However, because the data will be stored in a cookie, there’s a size limitation. Currently, preview data is limited to 2KB.
Works with
getServerSideProps
The preview mode works on
getServerSideProps
as well. It will also be available on the
context
object containing
preview
and
previewData
.
Good to know
: You shouldn't set the
Cache-Control
header when using Preview Mode because it cannot be bypassed. Instead, we recommend using
ISR
.
Works with API Routes
API Routes will have access to
preview
and
previewData
under the request object. For example:
export
default
function
myApiRoute
(req
,
res) {
const
isPreview
=
req
.preview
const
previewData
=
req
.previewData
// ...
}
Unique per
next build
Both the bypass cookie value and the private key for encrypting the
previewData
change when
next build
is completed.
This ensures that the bypass cookie can’t be guessed.
Good to know
: To test Preview Mode locally over HTTP your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.
