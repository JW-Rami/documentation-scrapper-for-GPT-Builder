Functions
useSelectedLayoutSegments
useSelectedLayoutSegments
useSelectedLayoutSegments
is a
Client Component
hook that lets you read the active route segments
below
the Layout it is called from.
It is useful for creating UI in parent Layouts that need knowledge of active child segments such as breadcrumbs.
app/example-client-component.tsx
'use client'
import
{ useSelectedLayoutSegments }
from
'next/navigation'
export
default
function
ExampleClientComponent
() {
const
segments
=
useSelectedLayoutSegments
()
return
(
<
ul
>
{
segments
.map
((segment
,
index)
=>
(
<
li
key
=
{index}>{segment}</
li
>
))}
</
ul
>
)
}
Good to know
:
Since
useSelectedLayoutSegments
is a
Client Component
hook, and Layouts are
Server Components
by default,
useSelectedLayoutSegments
is usually called via a Client Component that is imported into a Layout.
The returned segments include
Route Groups
, which you might not want to be included in your UI. You can use the
filter()
array method to remove items that start with a bracket.
Parameters
const
segments
=
useSelectedLayoutSegments
(parallelRoutesKey
?:
string)
useSelectedLayoutSegments
optionally
accepts a
parallelRoutesKey
, which allows you to read the active route segment within that slot.
Returns
useSelectedLayoutSegments
returns an array of strings containing the active segments one level down from the layout the hook was called from. Or an empty array if none exist.
For example, given the Layouts and URLs below, the returned segments would be:
Layout
Visited URL
Returned Segments
app/layout.js
/
[]
app/layout.js
/dashboard
['dashboard']
app/layout.js
/dashboard/settings
['dashboard', 'settings']
app/dashboard/layout.js
/dashboard
[]
app/dashboard/layout.js
/dashboard/settings
['settings']
