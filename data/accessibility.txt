Accessibility
The Next.js team is committed to making Next.js accessible to all developers (and their end-users). By adding accessibility features to Next.js by default, we aim to make the Web more inclusive for everyone.
Route Announcements
When transitioning between pages rendered on the server (e.g. using the
<a href>
tag) screen readers and other assistive technology announce the page title when the page loads so that users understand that the page has changed.
In addition to traditional page navigations, Next.js also supports client-side transitions for improved performance (using
next/link
). To ensure that client-side transitions are also announced to assistive technology, Next.js includes a route announcer by default.
The Next.js route announcer looks for the page name to announce by first inspecting
document.title
, then the
<h1>
element, and finally the URL pathname. For the most accessible user experience, ensure that each page in your application has a unique and descriptive title.
Linting
Next.js provides an
integrated ESLint experience
out of the box, including custom rules for Next.js. By default, Next.js includes
eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
to help catch accessibility issues early, including warning on:
aria-props
aria-proptypes
aria-unsupported-elements
role-has-required-aria-props
role-supports-aria-props
For example, this plugin helps ensure you add alt text to
img
tags, use correct
aria-*
attributes, use correct
role
attributes, and more.
