Optimizing
Instrumentation
Instrumentation
If you export a function named
register
from a
instrumentation.ts
(or
.js
) file in the
root directory
of your project (or inside the
src
folder if using one), we will call that function whenever a new Next.js server instance is bootstrapped.
Good to know
This feature is
experimental
. To use it, you must explicitly opt in by defining
experimental.instrumentationHook = true;
in your
next.config.js
.
The
instrumentation
file should be in the root of your project and not inside the
app
or
pages
directory. If you're using the
src
folder, then place the file inside
src
alongside
pages
and
app
.
If you use the
pageExtensions
config option
to add a suffix, you will also need to update the
instrumentation
filename to match.
We have created a basic
with-opentelemetry
example that you can use.
When your
register
function is deployed, it will be called on each cold boot (but exactly once in each environment).
Sometimes, it may be useful to import a file in your code because of the side effects it will cause. For example, you might import a file that defines a set of global variables, but never explicitly use the imported file in your code. You would still have access to the global variables the package has declared.
You can import files with side effects in
instrumentation.ts
, which you might want to use in your
register
function as demonstrated in the following example:
your-project/instrumentation.ts
import
{ init }
from
'package-init'
export
function
register
() {
init
()
}
However, we recommend importing files with side effects using
import
from within your
register
function instead. The following example demonstrates a basic usage of
import
in a
register
function:
your-project/instrumentation.ts
export
async
function
register
() {
await
import
(
'package-with-side-effect'
)
}
By doing this, you can colocate all of your side effects in one place in your code, and avoid any unintended consequences from importing files.
We call
register
in all environments, so it's necessary to conditionally import any code that doesn't support both
edge
and
nodejs
. You can use the environment variable
NEXT_RUNTIME
to get the current environment. Importing an environment-specific code would look like this:
your-project/instrumentation.ts
export
async
function
register
() {
if
(
process
.
env
.
NEXT_RUNTIME
===
'nodejs'
) {
await
import
(
'./instrumentation-node'
)
}
if
(
process
.
env
.
NEXT_RUNTIME
===
'edge'
) {
await
import
(
'./instrumentation-edge'
)
}
}
