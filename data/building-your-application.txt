Pages Router
Building Your Application
Building Your Application
Next.js provides the building blocks to create flexible, full-stack web applications. The guides in
Building Your Application
explain how to use these features and how to customize your application's behavior.
The sections and pages are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your Next.js application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.
If you're new to Next.js, we recommend starting with the
Routing
,
Rendering
,
Data Fetching
and
Styling
sections, as they introduce the fundamental Next.js and web concepts to help you get started. Then, you can dive deeper into the other sections such as
Optimizing
and
Configuring
. Finally, once you're ready, checkout the
Deploying
and
Upgrading
sections.
Routing
Learn the fundamentals of routing for front-end applications with the Pages Router.
Rendering
Learn the fundamentals of rendering in React and Next.js.
Data Fetching
Next.js allows you to fetch data in multiple ways, with pre-rendering, server-side rendering or static-site generation, and incremental static regeneration. Learn how to manage your application data in Next.js.
Styling
Learn the different ways you can style your Next.js application.
Optimizing
Optimize your Next.js application for best performance and user experience.
Configuring
Learn how to configure your Next.js application.
Testing
Learn how to set up Next.js with three commonly used testing tools — Cypress, Playwright, Vitest, and Jest.
Deploying
Learn how to deploy your Next.js app to production, either managed or self-hosted.
Upgrading
Learn how to upgrade to the latest versions of Next.js.
